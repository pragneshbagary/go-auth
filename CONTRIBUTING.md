## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
go test ./...

# Specific package
go test ./pkg/auth

go test ./... -bench=.
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Include both unit and integration tests
- Test error conditions and edge cases

Example test structure:
```go
func TestNewFeature(t *testing.T) {
    t.Run("successful_case", func(t *testing.T) {
        // Test successful operation
    })
    
    t.Run("error_case", func(t *testing.T) {
        // Test error handling
    })
}
```

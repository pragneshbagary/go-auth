# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines improvements to the go-Auth package to make it more user-friendly and easier to integrate into Go applications. The focus is on simplifying the API, improving database management, adding convenience features, and enhancing the developer experience. The goal is to reduce the amount of boilerplate code users need to write while maintaining the package's flexibility and security.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Go developer, I want a simplified initialization process, so that I can get started with authentication in just a few lines of code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer wants to use the package with default settings THEN the system SHALL provide a simple constructor function that requires only essential parameters
2. WHEN a developer initializes the auth service THEN the system SHALL automatically handle database table creation and migration
3. WHEN a developer uses the package for the first time THEN the system SHALL provide sensible defaults for JWT configuration
4. WHEN a developer wants to use SQLite storage THEN the system SHALL allow initialization with just a database file path

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Go developer, I want built-in database management, so that I don't have to manually handle database setup and migrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the auth service is initialized THEN the system SHALL automatically create required database tables if they don't exist
2. WHEN database schema changes are needed THEN the system SHALL provide migration utilities
3. WHEN using different storage backends THEN the system SHALL handle database-specific optimizations automatically
4. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL verify database connectivity and schema integrity

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Go developer, I want middleware integration helpers, so that I can easily protect my HTTP routes with minimal code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer wants to protect HTTP routes THEN the system SHALL provide ready-to-use middleware functions
2. WHEN middleware validates a token THEN the system SHALL automatically extract user information and add it to the request context
3. WHEN token validation fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP error responses
4. WHEN using popular Go web frameworks THEN the system SHALL provide framework-specific middleware adapters

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Go developer, I want enhanced user management features, so that I can handle common authentication scenarios without additional code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user needs to change their password THEN the system SHALL provide a secure password change function
2. WHEN a user forgets their password THEN the system SHALL support password reset token generation and validation
3. WHEN managing user accounts THEN the system SHALL provide functions to update user profiles
4. WHEN querying users THEN the system SHALL provide safe methods to retrieve user information without exposing sensitive data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Go developer, I want better token management, so that I can handle token refresh and revocation scenarios easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an access token expires THEN the system SHALL provide a simple token refresh function
2. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL support token revocation/blacklisting
3. WHEN tokens need to be validated THEN the system SHALL provide batch validation capabilities
4. WHEN managing sessions THEN the system SHALL provide utilities to list and manage active user sessions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Go developer, I want comprehensive configuration options, so that I can customize the package behavior for my specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the auth service THEN the system SHALL support environment variable-based configuration
2. WHEN setting up JWT THEN the system SHALL provide validation for configuration parameters
3. WHEN using different environments THEN the system SHALL support configuration profiles (dev, staging, prod)
4. WHEN customizing behavior THEN the system SHALL allow override of default settings while maintaining security

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a Go developer, I want better error handling and logging, so that I can debug issues and monitor authentication events effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide structured error types with clear messages
2. WHEN authentication events happen THEN the system SHALL support configurable logging levels
3. WHEN debugging issues THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error context without exposing sensitive information
4. WHEN monitoring the system THEN the system SHALL provide metrics and health check endpoints

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a Go developer, I want comprehensive examples and documentation, so that I can quickly understand how to use all package features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN learning the package THEN the system SHALL provide examples for common use cases
2. WHEN integrating with web frameworks THEN the system SHALL provide framework-specific examples
3. WHEN using advanced features THEN the system SHALL provide detailed documentation with code samples
4. WHEN troubleshooting THEN the system SHALL provide a comprehensive FAQ and troubleshooting guide

## Migration from v1 to v2

### Automatic Compatibility
All v1 code continues to work without changes:

```go
// v1 code still works in v2!
cfg := auth.Config{
    Storage: storage,
    JWT: auth.JWTConfig{
        AccessSecret: []byte("secret"),
        // ... rest of v1 config
    },
}
authService, err := auth.NewAuthService(cfg)
```

### New v2 API (Recommended)
```go
// Much simpler v2 API
authService, err := auth.New("auth.db", "jwt-secret")
```

### Migration Tools
Use our automated migration tool:
```bash
go install github.com/pragneshbagary/go-auth/cmd/migrate@v2.0.0
migrate -path . -output migration-report.txt
```
